Capstone Project


Feature List:

- Create a user account
- Edit profile information in case emails/phone numbers change
- Search for flights based on search queries, API will return the cheapest flights it finds
- Compare flights between the results
- Save search query to your dashboard so you can run it over and over without having to enter all the information again
- Edit search details to include maximum price, dates, location if things change
- Deactivate search once you have found the right ticket or you are no longer planning on taking that trip
- View general info about the destination such as weather, recent news stories, travel warnings and tourist attractions in the area.

Stretch Goals: 

- Add hotels to the search (and transportation if time allows)
- Create a schedule where you can add the tourist attractions to a calendar to plan out your trip ahead of time
- Set notifications to text(twilio) the user if a search shows up under their price range
- Google O Auth/facebook O Auth 
- Google map with pins of points interest (hand in hand with the Sygic API weâ€™ll be using for the tourist attractions)
